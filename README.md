# PythonLoop
QA Python Loop Task
Objectives: To design and implement a Python application that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 with the square value in the allotted time specified.
Requirements: Create a python application that will loop between 1 and 100, the numbers are to be printed out alongside their squared value, the app should stop when a squared value of 200 or more is reached, reconfigure the application to take in a user value to produce squared values up to.
Acceptance Criteria: Requirements + Explanation.
No syntax errots, correct format + code written and saved within a .py file, user interaction + user is prompted for input and applicaiton responds, variables + data storage through variables implemented, control flow and iteration + control flow through loops and conditional statements implemented.
